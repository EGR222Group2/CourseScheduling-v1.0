# EGR 222 Project
So this covers the basics of what we need to accomplish for the project. It isn't the prettiest. It isn't always the most efficient. And it's super long. But it works. Feel free to fix anything that needs fixing or neaten anything that needs neatening. If you have any questions about the project (because I know it's a LOT to take in at once), feel free to text me or stop me after class and I'll try my best to explain what I did and why.
