# EGR 222 Project
So this covers the basics of what we need to accomplish for the project. It isn't the prettiest. It isn't always the most efficient. But it works. Feel free to fix anything that needs fixing or neaten anything that could be organized better. If you have any questions about the project (because I know it's a LOT to take in at once), feel free to text me or stop me after class and I'll try my best to explain what I did and why.

TO-DO:

- Add class sections. (The program could search for any matches to the first 6 characters, and if there is, it can give the option to either type a new class or add a section to that class, which would simply add an "A" or "B" to the fullName variable).

- Convert the startTime and endTime variables from the 24 hour system to the 12 hour system.
